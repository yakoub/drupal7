templates with pattern names must be copied to,
a theme directory for them to be detected and take affect.

the patterns are regular expression, 
and the `__` component is only convetion for better readabilty.

so even if node-form doesn't use `__` component, it can still be applied to a pattern.


product form pattern | `product__.+-form`
---|---
applies to | `product--TAG-form.tpl.php`
generated by | products.module lines 61, 84, 104

node form pattern | `.+-node-form`
---|---
applies to | `TAG-node-form.tpl.php`
generated by | [drupal_prepare_form](http://cgit.drupalcode.org/drupal/tree/includes/form.inc?h=7.x#n1114)

the `product--cloths-form` override, add class `cloths` to wrapper and renders gender inside the `details` group.
while `product--food-form` override, only adds class `food`.

the `node-form` base template parition node form into two groups according to ordering of the fields under field ui `manage display`, so that all fields until `body` are in first group while all the rest in second group besides elements that belong to vertical tabs and actions buttons that are put in a bottom group.
while `page-node-form` override doesn't follow this parition at all and just renders the form as is.
